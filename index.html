         Real Freelance Problems (You’re Not Alone)
       </h2>
       <p>
         Many women freelancers struggle not because they lack skills, but because they are handling too many responsibilities at once. Freelancing often means managing work, clients, income, and personal life—all alone.
       </p>
       <h3>
         Problem List
       </h3>
       <ul>
         <li>Not enough time to manage everything</li>
         <li>Difficulty finding consistent clients</li>
         <li>Stress while writing proposals and emails</li>
         <li>Low confidence in pricing services</li>
         <li>Managing multiple clients and deadlines</li>
         <li>Burnout and poor work-life balance</li>
       </ul>
       <p>
         Each of these problems can be simplified with the right AI tools, when used correctly.
